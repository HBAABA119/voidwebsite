## üé® Layout Issues - FIXED

### Footer Display Problems
- **Issue**: Footer missing or inconsistent across pages
- **Fix**: 
  - Simplified layout structure in `layout.tsx`
  - Removed complex wrapper components that were interfering
  - Added `mt-auto` class to ensure footer sticks to bottom
  - Removed animation dependencies that were causing rendering issues

### Layout Structure Improvements
- Simplified page wrapper structure
- Removed unnecessary PageTransition and Breadcrumbs components that were causing conflicts
- Implemented consistent container structure across all pages

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations - IMPLEMENTED

### Animation Performance
1. **Reduced Animation Complexity**

   - Reduced transform operations (removed unnecessary scaling and rotation)
   - Optimized transition durations (300ms instead of 500ms+)

2. **Enhanced Intersection Observer**
   - Improved threshold settings (0.15 instead of 0.1)
   - Better rootMargin for earlier detection
   - Automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks

3. **GPU Acceleration**
   - Maintained `will-change` properties for critical animations
   - Used `transform3d` for hardware acceleration
   - Optimized animation triggers

4. **Reduced Motion Support**
   - Enhanced accessibility with proper reduced motion handling
   - Immediate visibility for users who prefer reduced motion
   - Graceful fallbacks for all animations

### Code Optimizations
- Removed redundant animation classes
- Simplified component structure
- Improved error boundary implementation
- Enhanced loading states

## üéØ Typography Improvements - IMPLEMENTED

### Font System Implementation
1. **Primary Font**: Inter
   - Modern, highly legible sans-serif
   - Excellent for both headings and body text
   - Wide range of weights (300-900)

2. **Monospace Font**: JetBrains Mono
   - Perfect for code snippets and technical content
   - Excellent readability
   - Consistent character spacing

### Typography Classes
- `.text-heading`: Bold headings with tight letter spacing
